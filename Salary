You're given a starting salary and a number of browser tabs that an employee has opened during work.
Each time the employee opens a social media site, their salary is reduced by a fixed amount:
- Facebook → 150 leva - 75 euro
- Instagram → 100 leva - 50 euro
- Reddit → 50 leva - 25 euro
If at any point the salary becomes zero or less, the program should stop checking further

FACEBOOK = 150
INSTAGRAM = 100
REDDIT = 50

n = int(input())
salary = float(input())


for _ in range(n):
    website = input()

    if website == 'Facebook':
        salary -= 150
    elif website == 'Instagram':
        salary -= 100
    elif website == 'Reddit':
        salary -= 50

    if salary <= 0:
        print("You have lost your salary.")
        break
else:
    print(int(salary))
