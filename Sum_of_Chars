Write a program that reads a number N, then reads N characters (one per line), 
calculates the sum of their ASCII values, and prints the total sum.

number_of_lines = int(input())
total_sum_of_ASCII = 0

for letter_per_line in range(number_of_lines):
    letter = input()
    total_sum_of_ASCII += ord(letter)
print(f'The sum equals: {total_sum_of_ASCII}')
