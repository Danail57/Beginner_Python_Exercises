Lily is saving money for a washing machine. Every year for her birthday:
- If it's an odd-numbered birthday (1st, 3rd, 5th...), she receives one toy.
- If it's an even-numbered birthday (2nd, 4th, 6th...), she receives money that increases by 10 units each time (10 on the 2nd birthday, 20 on the 4th, etc.).
- However, on every even-numbered birthday, her brother takes 1 unit from the money she receives.
Lily sells all her toys at a fixed toy price and combines the money with the amount she received on even-numbered birthdays.
Your program should determine whether Lily has enough money to buy a washing machine,

age = int(input())
washing_machine_price = float(input())
toy_price = int(input())

saved_money = 0
toy_counter = 0
money_gift = 10

for birthday in range(1, age + 1):
    if birthday % 2 == 0:
        saved_money += money_gift
        money_gift += 10
        saved_money -= 1
    else:
        toy_counter += 1

total_toy_money = toy_counter * toy_price
saved_money += total_toy_money

difference = saved_money - washing_machine_price
if difference >= 0:
    print(f'Yes! {difference:.2f}')
else:
    print(f'No! {abs(difference):.2f}')
