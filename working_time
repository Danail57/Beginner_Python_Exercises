Write a program that checks whether a shop is open or closed based on the current time and day of the week.

day_time = int(input())
week_day = input()

if 10 <= day_time <= 18 and week_day in ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"]:
    print('open')
else:
    print('closed')
